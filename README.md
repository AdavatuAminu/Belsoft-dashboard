The KonnectU Admin Dashboard is a Next.js-based application that provides an administrative interface for managing jobs, revenue, performance, and user accounts, featuring a responsive design with interactive elements like dropdowns, charts, and a collapsible sidebar, optimized for desktop and mobile devices. It leverages technologies such as Tailwind CSS for styling, Recharts for charting, and React hooks for state management, requiring Node.js (v14.x or later) and npm/yarn for installation, which involves cloning the repository, installing dependencies with `npm install`, and running the development server with `npm run dev` to access it at `http://localhost:3000`. The dashboard includes components like `Header` for search and sorting, `Sidebar` for navigation, `RevenueChart` for financial insights, `JobOversight` for job management with filterable dropdowns, `AccountManagement` for user control, `PerformanceDashboard` for metrics, and `PopularTaskSpecialist` for highlighting top-rated specialists, all organized in a file structure with `components/`, `pages/`, and `public/` directories. The project supports responsive design using Tailwind CSS prefixes, ensuring adaptability across screen sizes.
